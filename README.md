# Your Todo App

This is a Todo application that handles CRUD operation and it uses localStorage.

## Tech

- React.js
- Typescript
- Javascript
- TailwindCSS
- ShadCN (component library)

### Purpose

This app was created to get familiar with react.js. I was able to explore some of the core React Concepts such as Hooks (state, effect, memo), props, children, etc. Also, I was able to work with vite and use a component library such as shadcn.

### Installation

- Clone this repo
- Go to the repo's folder: cd react-app
- run pnpm install
- Then, run pnpm dev

Note: I used pnpm since it provides great speed and storage efficiency. However other packages management tool can be used such as npm or yarn.
